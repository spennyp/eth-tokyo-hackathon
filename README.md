### Smart Contracts

Built using Foundry. A microfinance P2P protocol can be found in our main contract and this enables permissionless lending and borrowing.

### Graph

A subgraph that fetches all lending data -> will eventually be used to scaffold into a social credit score by leveraging subgraph indexing.

### Web Application

A React + Next.JS project that uses the above technologies in order to serve a delightful and Splend-id experience to our end users.
